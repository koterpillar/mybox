# Mybox

🖥️ This is a box. 📦 And it is mine. 🐱

There are many 🍱 nice things in there. I wouldn't want 🧰 to be without them.

Even if I move 🏠 or work 🏢 I want to be comfortable.

Manage the configuration and tools on your workstation without bothering the OS
too much (maybe your favorite one isn't supported by `$WORK` or you have
different ones for different roles).
